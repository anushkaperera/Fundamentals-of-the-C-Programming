A C program may contain multiple .c files (C source files), .h files (C header files), Assembly source files, Assembly include file and 
object file libraries.

A C project may have one of two objectives; you can either create an executable or object file libraries. An object file library are 
intended to be used with other C project. 

Compiler tool chain work flow: there are three main components, (1) C compiler, (2) Assembler and (3) Linker. A C compiler convertes .c 
and .h files into Assembly files. The assembler is responsible for creating object files. From here we can do two things; (1) creating 
object file libraries (the Archiver is used to do this) and (2) creating an executable using the Linker, where the Linker used object 
files and object file libraries. The Linker should be provided a linker script. A compiler tool chain normally come with a default linker script. To be precise, the Linker combines the object files created from your C program and the startup code when creating the excecutable file. 

I will use following tools in this course:
	*Ubuntu 20.04 PC
	*GCC toolchain

This is a brief introduction to C, however I will try to make it concise enough so that you can easily find ways to move forward.
