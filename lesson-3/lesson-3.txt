Text Substitution Labels:
	*We can use 
		#define label text	
	to replace label by text in main.c file.

	*For example,
		#define PI (3.14159265359)
	means that every place the preprocessor finds PI in main.c, 
	PI will be replaced by (3.14159265359).

	*Alternatively, we could have defined a variable like this:
		const float PI = 3.14159265359
	But this will waster a few bytes in the memory.
