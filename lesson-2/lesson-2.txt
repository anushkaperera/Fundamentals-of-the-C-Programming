This folder contains just single .c files, and the program prints a string to the screen. This is not so useful program, but you got to know
how to compile main.c file using the command gcc -Wall main.c -o main. 

About main.c:
	*In this file we use the function <printf>. Where does it come from? This functions prototype is defined in the header file stdio.h, therefore 
	we need to included stdio.h file in main.c. We will learn more about header files in details later.

	*If you want to create an executable, every C program must have one .c file which defines the <main> function. The <main> is the one
	starts after the C runtime code executed. 

	*<int main()> means the <main> function taked no input parameters and returns an integer.
