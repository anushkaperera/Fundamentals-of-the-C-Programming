A variable has a data type and a name (or an identifier). Different data types may occupy different number of bytes in the memory. 

Data types:
	*unsigned char, char (=signed char)
	*unsigned short int, short int (=signed short int)
	*unsigned int, int (=signed int)
	*unsigned long int, long int (=signed long int)
	*unsigned long long int, long long int (=unsigned long long int)
	*float
	*double
	*long double

In this lesson you will learn how to find respective sizes of different data types using the sizeof operator. Also, how to define and use variables.
